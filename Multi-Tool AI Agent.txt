[Mod 17] Project: Building a Multi-Tool AI Agent to Interact
🧠 Assignment: Building a Multi-Tool AI Agent to Interact with Medical Datasets and Web
🎯 Objective:
You will build a Multi-Tool OpenAI Agent that can:

Answer data-specific queries from three medical datasets (Heart Disease, Cancer, Diabetes)


Use a Web Search Tool for general medical knowledge (e.g., definitions, symptoms, cures)


📁 Provided Datasets:
Use the following public medical datasets:

Heart Disease Dataset
 🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset


Cancer Prediction Dataset
 🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/cancer-prediction-dataset


Diabetes Dataset
 🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set


🛠️ Project Tasks:
✅ 1. Convert CSVs to SQLite DBs
For each dataset, create a SQLite database.


Name the DBs:



heart_disease.db


cancer.db


diabetes.db


Ensure that table names are meaningful and column types are set correctly.


✅ 2. Build DB-specific Agents (Tools)
For each DB, build a tool using the OpenAI Agent SDK +Langchain Agent that can:

Connect to the corresponding database


Execute user questions via SQL


Return the result in natural language


Tools to implement:

HeartDiseaseDBTool


CancerDBTool


DiabetesDBTool


✅ 3. Add a Web Search Tool
Create a tool named MedicalWebSearchTool that uses:

An API like SerpAPI, Tavily, or Bing 

Use this tool only for general medical knowledge.

✅ 4. Main AI Agent Logic
Build a main AI Agent using OpenAI’s Agent SDK + Langchain Agen Executor.


It should route the question to the appropriate tool:



🧠 If the question is about statistics, data, or numbers, it should use the appropriate DB tool.


🌐 If the question is about definition, symptoms, or cure, it should use the Web Search tool.
